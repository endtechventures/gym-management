# Future Edge Function Development

This document provides guidance for implementing Edge Functions in the future, after the main application is successfully deployed.

## Important: Keep Edge Functions Separate

To avoid deployment issues, Edge Functions should be developed and deployed separately from the main application. This is because Edge Functions use Deno, which has different dependencies and import mechanisms than Node.js.

## Steps for Future Edge Function Development

1. Create a separate repository for your Edge Functions
2. Develop and test your Edge Functions locally using the Supabase CLI
3. Deploy your Edge Functions directly to Supabase using the CLI
4. Update your application to call the deployed Edge Functions

## Example Edge Function for Member Import Processing

Here's an example of how you might implement an Edge Function for processing member imports in the future:

\`\`\`typescript
// This code should NOT be included in your main application repository
// It should be developed and deployed separately

import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"
import { createClient } from "https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2"

serve(async (req) => {
  // Implementation details...
})
\`\`\`

## Deployment Instructions

1. Install the Supabase CLI
2. Login to your Supabase account
3. Create a new directory for your Edge Function
4. Deploy using `supabase functions deploy function-name`

Remember to keep your Edge Function code completely separate from your main application code to avoid deployment issues.
